# Tutorial: commenting
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Comments are a good way of writing useful information in your code or to temporarily disable  
# some instructions that will not be executed.

# To comment you must use the '#' character. Any text on a line, that follows the
# '#' character will be considered a comment.

# this is a single-line comment
echo "hello!" # this is also a single-line comment that follows an instruction

# However, if you would write '!' immediately after a '#', you would create a shebang,
# an instruction that tells the operating system what interpreter should be used to run
# the file.
# As an example take the first line of this file that makes sure the OS will run this
# using Bash.
